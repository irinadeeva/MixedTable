## Overview

The main objective of this project is to create a full-screen table view with at least 30 cells, where each cell has interactive and animated behavior:

- **Cell Reordering**: When a cell is tapped, it animates to the top of the list, and a checkmark appears on the right side.
- **Toggle Checkmark**: If a cell with a checkmark is tapped again, the checkmark disappears, indicating deselection.
- **Shuffle Button**: A button in the top-right corner triggers an animation that randomly shuffles the cells.

## Table Features

- **Full-Screen Display**: The table occupies the entire screen for immersive interaction.
- **Animated Cell Movement**: Cells smoothly transition to the top when selected.
- **Shuffle Animation**: The shuffle button animates cell positions randomly within the table for a dynamic layout.
